        <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>
          Heart attacks are typically diagnosed in an emergency situation. If
          someone shows signs of a heart attack, such as chest pain, shortness
          of breath, or discomfort in the upper body, it’s essential to seek
          medical help immediately. Health care providers will assess the
          symptoms and perform tests to confirm a heart attack.

            >Test Here are common tests used to diagnose a heart attack:</strong
          >
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG):</strong> This is the first
            test done to measure the heart’s electrical activity. Sticky patches
            are placed on the chest and limbs, and the heart’s electrical
            signals are displayed as waves. An ECG can show whether a heart
            attack is occurring or has occurred.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Blood Tests:</strong> Certain enzymes are released into the
            bloodstream after a heart attack. Blood tests can check for these
            cardiac markers to confirm heart damage.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Chest X-ray:</strong> This is used to visualize the heart
            and lungs to check for abnormalities or complications.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Coronary Angiography:</strong> A catheter is inserted into
            an artery and dye is injected to check for blockages in the heart’s
            blood vessels.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Cardiac MRI or CT scan:</strong> These tests create detailed
            images of the heart to assess damage.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>
          Heart attack treatment is focused on restoring blood flow to the heart
          as quickly as possible. Time is critical, as prolonged blockage can
          lead to permanent heart damage.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>Medications:</strong> Common heart attack treatments include:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Aspirin:</strong> This medication reduces blood clotting and
            helps keep blood flowing through the arteries. You may be advised to
            chew an aspirin at the onset of symptoms.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Clot Busters (Thrombolytics):</strong> These drugs dissolve
            blood clots that are blocking blood flow. The sooner they are
            administered, the better the chances of recovery.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Blood Thinners:</strong> Medications like heparin reduce the
            blood’s tendency to clot, helping to prevent further blockages.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Nitroglycerin:</strong> This widens the blood vessels,
            improving blood flow to the heart and relieving chest pain.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Beta Blockers:</strong> These slow down the heart and reduce
            its workload, limiting further damage.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>ACE Inhibitors:</strong> These lower blood pressure and
            reduce stress on the heart.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>Surgical Procedures:</strong>In some cases, procedures may be
          necessary to restore blood flow:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Angiography and Stenting:</strong>A balloon is used to open
            blocked arteries, and a stent is inserted to keep them open
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG):</strong>This surgery
            rerouthes blood around blocked arteries using a healthy blood vessel
            from another part of the body.
          </li>
          <br />
        </ul>
        <p>
          Cardiac Rehabilitation after a heart attack, cardiac rehabilitation
          involves exercises, education, and support to help patients recover
          and prevent future heart attacks. it includes diet changes, stress
          management, and gradually returning to daily activties.

          How to Assist Someone During a Heart Attack Before Medical Help
          Arrives
        </h3>
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Call For emergency help immediately:</strong>Call Dial your
            local emergency number as soon as you suspect a heart attack. Even
            if symptoms seem mid, don't hesitate to seek help.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Keep the person calm and seated:</strong>Help the person sit
            down preferably in a comfortable position with their knees bent and
            back supported. This eases strain on the heart and helps blood
            circulation
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Give them aspirin if available:</strong>If the person is
            conscious and not allergic to aspirin, give them a 300 mg tablet of
            aspirin to chew. This helps reduce blood clothing.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Loosen tight clothing:</strong>Loosen any clothing that may
            be restrctive, such as belts or tight collars, to help with their
            breathing.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Monitor breathing and consciousness:</strong>Keep an eye on
            their condition. If they lose consciousness or stop breathing, start
            CPR immediately. Push hard and fast in the center of their chest,
            performing chest compressions until emergency arrives.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Use nitroglycerin if prescribed:</strong>If they have been
            prescribed nitroglycerin for heart conditions, assist them in taking
            it according to their doctor’s instructions.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Stay with them and provide reassurance:</strong>Stay calm
            and supportive. Encourage the person to stay calm and breathe
            steadily. Anxiety can worsen the situation, so keep reassuring them
            that help is on the way.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Look for severe signs:</strong>If the person experiences
            worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, or shows signs of shock
            (pale skin, sweating or blush lips) treat this as a critical
            situation.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>Remember:</strong> Time is crucial during a heart attack.
          Immediate action can save a life. Always call for emergency for help
          at the first sign of heart attack
