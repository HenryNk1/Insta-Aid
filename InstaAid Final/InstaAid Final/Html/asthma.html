        <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>
          Asthma is usually diagnosed through a combination of a medical
          history, physical exam, and tests. If you have symptoms like shortness
          of breath, wheezing, or persistent coughing, a healthcare provider
          will assess your condition to confirm if it's asthma.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>Tests Here are common tests used to diagnose asthma:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Spirometry:</strong> This test measures how much air you can
            exhale after a deep breath and how fast you can breathe out. It's
            used to check for airway narrowing or obstruction.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Peak flow test:</strong> A peak flow meter is a simple
            device that measures how hard you can breathe out. Lower-than-normal
            readings suggest your lungs may not be working well, indicating
            asthma.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Methacholine challenge:</strong> This test involves inhaling
            a substance called methacholine, which can cause airway constriction
            in people with asthma. If your lung function drops after inhaling
            methacholine, it’s a sign of asthma.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Allergy tests:</strong> Skin or blood tests are used to
            identify allergens that may be triggering asthma symptoms.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Exhaled nitric oxide test:</strong> This test measures the
            amount of nitric oxide, a marker of inflammation, in your breath.
            Higher levels may indicate asthma.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Chest X-ray or CT scan:</strong> These are typically used to
            rule out other conditions, like infections or lung diseases, that
            might be causing your symptoms.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          Early diagnosis helps with effective management and treatment,
          reducing the risk of severe asthma attacks.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>
          Asthma treatment focuses on managing symptoms, preventing attacks, and
          maintaining normal lung function. Asthma can be controlled with proper
          medication and by avoiding triggers that cause symptoms.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>Medications:</strong> There are two main types of asthma
          medications: quick-relief medications for sudden symptoms and
          long-term control medications for daily management.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Quick-Relief (Rescue) Inhalers:</strong> These inhalers,
            like albuterol, are used during an asthma attack to quickly open the
            airways and relieve symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, or
            shortness of breath.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Corticosteroids (Inhaled):</strong> These are the most
            common long-term asthma medications. They help reduce inflammation
            in the airways, making it easier to breathe over time.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Leukotriene Modifiers:</strong> These oral medications
            reduce airway inflammation and can prevent asthma symptoms for up to
            24 hours.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Long-Acting Beta Agonists (LABAs):</strong> These inhalers
            are used daily to control chronic asthma symptoms and help prevent
            future attacks.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Combination Inhalers:</strong> These inhalers contain both a
            long-acting beta-agonist and a corticosteroid for better long-term
            control.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Allergy Medications:</strong> If asthma is triggered by
            allergies, antihistamines or other allergy medications may help
            manage symptoms.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Lifestyle and Environmental Control</strong></p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Avoiding Triggers:</strong> Knowing and avoiding asthma
            triggers (such as dust, pollen, pet dander, and smoke) is key to
            preventing asthma attacks.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Regular Monitoring:</strong> Using a peak flow meter to
            track lung function can help in recognizing early signs of an asthma
            flare-up before symptoms worsen.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Healthy Lifestyle:</strong> Staying active, managing stress,
            and maintaining a healthy diet can all help improve overall lung
            health and minimize asthma symptoms.
          </li>
          <br />
        </ul>

          How to Assist Someone During an Asthma Attack Before Medical Help
          Arrives
        </h2>
        <p>
          If someone is having an asthma attack, it’s important to stay calm and
          help them manage their symptoms quickly. Here’s what you can do:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Sit the person upright:</strong> Help them sit upright in a
            comfortable position. Encourage them to remain calm, as panic can
            make breathing more difficult.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Use their inhaler:</strong>
            <ul>
              <br />
              <li>
                If they have a rescue inhaler (usually a blue inhaler), assist
                them in using it. Shake the inhaler and have them take one puff,
                inhaling slowly and deeply.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                Have them wait 30-60 seconds between puffs. They can take up to
                4 puffs if needed.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Loosen tight clothing:</strong> If their clothing is
            restrictive, help loosen it to make breathing easier.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Keep them calm:</strong> Reassure them to breathe slowly and
            deeply. This helps prevent hyperventilation, which can worsen
            symptoms.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Monitor symptoms:</strong>
            <ul>
              <br />
              <li>
                If symptoms don't improve within 5-10 minutes of using the
                inhaler, or if they worsen, seek emergency help immediately.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                If they don't have their inhaler, call for emergency help right
                away.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Call for medical help:</strong>
            <ul>
              <br />
              <li>
                Dial your local emergency number if the inhaler is not working
                or if the person’s condition is getting worse.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                Look for signs of severe distress, such as difficulty speaking,
                bluish lips, or drowsiness. These indicate a medical emergency.
              </li>
              <br />
            </ul>
