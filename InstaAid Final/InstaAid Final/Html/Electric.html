        <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>
          Electric shock can vary in severity, from minor burns to
          life-threatening internal damage. Diagnosis in a medical setting
          involves assessing the visible injuries and determining whether the
          electric shock has caused deeper internal damage, such as heart issues
          or nerve damage.

            >Test Here are common tests used to diagnose the extent of damage
            from an electric shock:</strong
          >
        </p>
        <ul>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Physical Exam:</strong> The healthcare provider will check
            for burns, entry and exit wounds, and any signs of trauma caused by
            the shock.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG):</strong> This test records
            the heart’s electrical activity. Since electric shock can affect
            heart rhythms, an ECG is used to check for irregularities or damage.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Blood Tests:</strong> These tests check for signs of muscle
            damage, kidney injury, or the release of certain chemicals, such as
            potassium, that may occur after an electric shock.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Imaging Tests (X-ray, CT, or MRI):</strong> Depending on the
            severity of the shock, these tests may be done to check for
            fractures, internal injuries, or damage to organs.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Neurological Evaluation:</strong> If the shock has affected
            the brain or nervous system, neurological tests may be used to
            assess cognitive and motor functions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>
          Treatment for electric shock depends on the severity of the injury. In
          minor cases, burns or superficial wounds may be treated, while severe
          electric shocks may require intensive care.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>Medications:</strong> Medications used to treat electric shock
          injuries may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Pain Relievers:</strong> These help manage pain from burns
            or other injuries.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Antibiotics:</strong> If the electric shock caused burns or
            open wounds, antibiotics may be prescribed to prevent infection.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Cardiac Medications:</strong> If the shock affected the
            heart, medications like beta-blockers or antiarrhythmics may be
            needed to stabilize heart rhythm.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>IV Fluids:</strong> Intravenous fluids help maintain blood
            pressure and support kidney function, especially if muscle damage is
            significant.
          </li>
          <br />
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Surgical Procedures:</strong> If severe burns or tissue damage
          occurred, surgery may be necessary:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Debridement:</strong> This procedure removes damaged tissue
            to promote healing and prevent infection.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Skin Grafts:</strong> If burns are extensive, skin grafts
            may be used to repair damaged areas.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Cardiac Surgery:</strong> In rare cases, surgery may be
            required if the heart sustained damage that medication cannot treat.
          </li>

          How to Assist Someone During an Electric Shock Before Medical Help
          Arrives
        </h2>
        <p>
          If someone has been electrocuted, here’s what you can do to help them
          before medical help arrives:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Turn off the power source:</strong> Do not touch the person
            until you are sure the source of electricity is turned off. Use a
            non-conductive object (like a wooden broom handle) to move them away
            from the source if you can’t turn it off.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Check for a response:</strong> Once the power source is off,
            check if the person is conscious and breathing. If they are
            unresponsive, call for emergency help immediately.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Call emergency services:</strong> Dial your local emergency
            number and inform them of the situation. Be ready to describe the
            person's condition.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Do not move them:</strong> If the person has fallen or been
            thrown by the shock, there could be potential spine or head
            injuries. Only move them if they are in immediate danger.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Start CPR if necessary:</strong>
            <ul>
              <br />
              <li>
                If the person is not breathing or does not have a pulse, begin
                CPR. Push hard and fast in the center of their chest at a rate
                of 100-120 compressions per minute. Continue until medical help
                arrives or they begin to breathe on their own.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                If you are trained in rescue breathing, alternate 30 chest
                compressions with 2 breaths.
              </li>
              <br />
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Check for burns or injuries:</strong> Once the immediate
            danger has passed, assess the person for burns at the entry and exit
            points of the electrical current. If there are burns, cover them
            with a sterile cloth or bandage to prevent infection.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Keep them warm:</strong> If the person is conscious, cover
            them with a blanket to keep them warm and comfortable while waiting
            for medical help.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Reassure and monitor:</strong> Stay with the person, keep
            them calm, and monitor their breathing and pulse until medical
            professionals arrive.
          </li>
          <br />
        </ol>

        <p>
          <strong>Remember:</strong> Electric shock can cause internal damage
          even if external injuries seem minor. Always seek medical help after
          an electric shock, even if the person appears to recover quickly.
